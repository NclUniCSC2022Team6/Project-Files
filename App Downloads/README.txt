**** HOW TO INSTALL ****
Once enabled, download the signed apk, go to a file manager, locate the file, 
click on it to install and follow the steps (if the installation is blocked by Play Protect, click on install anyway). 
Don't be worried if it does not install. Simply download the unsigned apk and try that.
